This is very good tutorial if you are getting started with NodeJS, ExpressJS and MongoDB 
- http://howtonode.org/express-mongodb

ONLY problem is that the article is really really old and the code does now work anymore.

I've fixed all the issues and made this tutorial compatible with this environment:
* node - v0.10.3
* mongodb - v2.4.8
* express - v3.4.7


To run
---
* Clone the repo
* You need node on your system (read the article above to see how to get all dependencies)
* run 'npm install' to get app dependencies
* run mongodb like so - 'mongod'
* run your app like so - 'node app.js'
* Go to localhost:3000 to see app working
