tmp-nodejs-express-mongoDB-blog
===============================

This is very good tutorial if you getting started with NodeJS, ExpressJS and MongoDB 
- http://howtonode.org/express-mongodb

ONLY problem is that the article is really really old and the code does now work anymore.

I've fixed all the issues and made this tutorial compatible with this environment:
* node - v0.10.3
* mongodb - v2.4.8
* express - v3.4.7
